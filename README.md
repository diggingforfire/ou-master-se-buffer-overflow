# OU Master SE - Software Security buffer overflow examples

This repository contains two examples for buffer overflows in C:
* [CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/787.html) 
* [CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/125.html)

Running the provided Dockerfile will compile and run them with gcc on debian.
